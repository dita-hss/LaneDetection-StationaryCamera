# Lane Detection Algorithm

This project implements a lane detection algorithm using OpenCV. It detects and draws lane lines on an input image or video using various image processing techniques.


The project directory structure is as follows:

- lanes_picture.py: Script for detecting lane lines in a single image.
- lanes_video.py: Script for detecting lane lines in a video.
- test_video.mp4: An example input video for testing.
- test_image.png: An example input image for testing.
